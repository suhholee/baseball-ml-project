# Baseball Hit Outcome Prediction Project âš¾

## Overview
This project aims to predict the outcome of a batted ball in baseball (e.g., Single, Double, Home Run, Out) based on quantifiable pitch and swing metrics sourced from Statcast data via Baseball Savant. The goal is to leverage machine learning to provide insights for players, coaches, and analysts, potentially identifying key factors that lead to successful (or unsuccessful) batted ball events.

This end-to-end project demonstrates skills in web scraping, data cleaning, feature engineering, model training/evaluation, hyperparameter optimization, model interpretation, cloud integration, and interactive dashboard creation.
